        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Dal Makhani is a classic Indian dish made with whole black lentils (urad dal) and kidney beans (rajma)
            slow-cooked to creamy perfection in a rich, buttery, and smoky tomato-based gravy. It's known for its
            luxurious texture and deep flavors, often finished with a swirl of cream and fresh cilantro.</p>
        <p>This comforting and hearty vegetarian main is a staple in North Indian cuisine and a must-try for anyone
            exploring Indian flavors. It pairs wonderfully with naan bread, rice, or roti.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup whole black lentils (urad dal), washed and soaked overnight</li>
            <li>1/4 cup kidney beans (rajma), washed and soaked overnight</li>
            <li>4 cups water (for pressure cooking)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp ghee or oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste</li>
            <li>1 cup tomato puree (from 2-3 ripe tomatoes)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp turmeric powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp red chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp coriander powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp garam masala</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup fresh cream (or coconut cream for dairy-free)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp butter (or vegan butter for dairy-free)</li>
            <li>Fresh cilantro, chopped, for garnish</li>
            <li>For Tempering (optional but recommended for smoky flavor)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp ghee or oil</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp cumin seeds</li>
            <li>2-3 dried red chilies</li>
            <li>A pinch of asafoetida (hing)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the Lentils: Drain the soaked black lentils and kidney beans. In a pressure cooker, combine
                them with 4 cups of fresh water. Cook on high pressure for 6-8 whistles (or about 25-30 minutes after
                the first whistle) until very soft and mushy. If not using a pressure cooker, boil them in a pot with
                plenty of water until tender, which may take 1-2 hours. Mash some of the lentils lightly with the back
                of a spoon for a creamier texture.</li>
            <li>Prepare the Gravy Base: Heat ghee or oil in a large heavy-bottomed pan or pot over medium heat. Add
                the chopped onion and saut√© until golden brown, about 8-10 minutes. Stir in the ginger-garlic paste and
                cook for another minute until the raw aroma disappears.</li>
            <li>Add Spices and Tomatoes: Add the tomato puree, turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder,
                and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the oil separates from the masala and the mixture thickens
                (about 8-10 minutes).</li>
            <li>Combine and Simmer: Add the cooked lentils and kidney beans to the gravy base. Add a little hot
                water if the dal is too thick, aiming for a creamy but flowing consistency. Bring to a gentle simmer,
                cover, and cook on low heat for at least 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to
                meld. The longer it simmers, the better it tastes.</li>
            <li>Finish the Dal: Stir in the garam masala, fresh cream, and butter. Mix well until everything is
                combined and heated through. Do not boil vigorously after adding cream.</li>
            <li>Prepare the Tempering (Tadka - Optional):** In a small pan, heat 1 tbsp ghee or oil over medium heat.
                Add cumin seeds; once they splutter, add dried red chilies and asafoetida. Cook for a few seconds until
                fragrant. Pour this tempering directly over the Dal Makhani.</li>
            <li>Serve: Garnish generously with fresh chopped cilantro. Serve hot with naan, roti, or steamed basmati
                rice.</li>
        </ol>
