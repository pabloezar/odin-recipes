            <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>9-12 lasagna noodles (oven-ready or pre-boiled)</li>
            <li>125g grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>250g shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>Fresh basil, for garnish (optional)</li>
            <li>**For the Béchamel Sauce:**</li>
            <li>50g unsalted butter</li>
            <li>50g all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>750ml milk, warm</li>
            <li>Pinch of nutmeg</li>
            <li>Salt and white pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>**Prepare the Meat Sauce:** Heat olive oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium heat. Add chopped
                onion and cook until softened, about 5-7 minutes. Stir in minced garlic and cook for another minute
                until fragrant. Add the ground meat, breaking it up with a spoon, and cook until browned. Drain any
                excess fat.</li>
            <li>**Simmer the Sauce:** Stir in the crushed tomatoes, red wine (if using), tomato paste, and oregano.
                Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low, cover, and let it cook for at least 30-45 minutes, or up to
                2 hours for deeper flavor, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>**Make the Béchamel Sauce:** While the meat sauce simmers, melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium
                heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes to form a roux. Gradually whisk in the warm milk, a
                little at a time, ensuring no lumps form. Continue whisking until the sauce thickens and comes to a
                gentle boil. Remove from heat and stir in nutmeg, salt, and white pepper.</li>
            <li>**Assemble the Lasagna:** Preheat your oven to 190°C (375°F). Spread a thin layer of meat sauce at the
                bottom of a 9x13 inch (23x33 cm) baking dish. Lay 3-4 lasagna noodles over the sauce. Top with a layer
                of meat sauce, then a layer of béchamel sauce, and sprinkle with some Parmesan and mozzarella. Repeat
                layers: noodles, meat sauce, béchamel, and cheese, until all ingredients are used, ending with a
                generous layer of béchamel and cheese on top.</li>
            <li>**Bake and Serve:** Cover the baking dish loosely with aluminum foil (you can spray the underside of the
                foil with cooking spray to prevent cheese from sticking). Bake for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and
                bake for another 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown. Let the lasagna rest for
                10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with fresh basil, if desired.</li>
