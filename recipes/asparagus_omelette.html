        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tbsp milk or water</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tsp olive oil or butter</li>
            <li>6-8 asparagus spears, tough ends snapped off and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>2 tbsp shredded cheese (cheddar, Gruyère, or feta work well) - optional</li>
            <li>Fresh chives or parsley, chopped, for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare Asparagus: Heat olive oil or butter in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the
                asparagus pieces and sauté for 3-5 minutes, or until tender-crisp. Remove asparagus from the skillet
                and set aside.</li>
            <li>Whisk Eggs: In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs with milk or water, salt, and pepper until light
                and frothy.</li>
            <li>Cook Omelette: Return the skillet to medium-low heat. If needed, add a tiny bit more oil or
                butter. Pour the egg mixture into the hot skillet. Let it cook undisturbed for about 1-2 minutes
                until the edges begin to set.</li>
            <li>Add Fillings: Once the top is mostly set but still a little runny, sprinkle the cooked asparagus
                over one half of the omelette. If using, sprinkle with cheese.</li>
            <li>Fold and Serve: Carefully fold the other half of the omelette over the filling. Cook for another
                30 seconds to 1 minute, or until the cheese is melted and the omelette is cooked to your desired
                doneness. Slide onto a plate and garnish with fresh chives or parsley, if desired. Serve
                immediately.</li>
        </ol>
